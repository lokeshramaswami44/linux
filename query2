This SQL project focuses on the employee_new1 table, created under the chitti database. It demonstrates the use of auto-incrementing primary keys, date handling, and multiple conditions in queries. This project is a great way to practice advanced table structures and conditional data filtering in SQL.

üìÅ Table Schema
CREATE TABLE employee_new1 (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    name VARCHAR(222),
    salary INT,
    date_of_joining DATE,
    manager_name VARCHAR(222),
    incentive INT,
    annual_commission INT
);
id is an auto-incrementing primary key using IDENTITY.

üìå Operations Performed
Database Creation
CREATE DATABASE chitti;
INSERT INTO employee_new1(name, salary, date_of_joining, manager_name, incentive, annual_commission)
VALUES 
('chinnu', 44432, '2024-04-06', 'akshay', 3000, 2000),
('uday', 44712, '2024-02-07', 'akshay', 3000, 1100),
('sri', 42372, '2024-08-06', 'akshay', 3000, 1340),
('ram', 74832, '2024-04-09', 'akshay', 3000, 1800);
SELECT * FROM employee_new1
WHERE name = 'chinnu' AND name = 'sri';
