This project demonstrates foundational SQL operations using a custom table called employee_21 created under the database sudheer. It includes real-world employee data and showcases various queries for data manipulation, filtering, and string operations. The project is designed to help understand how SQL handles:

Table creation and insertion of data

Data retrieval using SELECT statements

Filtering with WHERE and pattern matching

String functions like SUBSTRING and REPLACE

Aggregations using MIN, MAX, and GROUP BY

Handling NULL values

Table truncation and deletion
